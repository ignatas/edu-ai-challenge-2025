I have a bug ticket with only header “Logout button doesn’t work on Safari. It just doesn’t respond.”
I need a complete well structured ticket in JIRA made from that. Following the structure is important. It should contain:
1. Title
2. Description
3. Steps to Reproduce
4. Expected vs Actual Behavior
5. Environment (if known)
6. Severity or Impact
